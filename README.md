To run the game, run Gui.py. This will bring up a window with a map,
a green square, and two red squares. The green square is your character
and the red squares are the enemies. Your goal is to run from the enemies
for as long as you can. The controls are up:"w", down: "s", left:"a" and 
right:"d". When you die, you must click reset to reset the board.

To run a text based version of the game, run Game.py.
